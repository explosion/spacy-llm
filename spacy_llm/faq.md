### Do I need a GPU to run this?

Not necessarily. Some models require a GPU, but if you don't have access to one, you have a few options:
- TODO

### Do I need access to OpenAI to use this library?

No - you can use other backends and models, like Dolly (TODO)


### What format can I provide the examples in for few-shot learning?

- srsly: srsly.read_yaml(yml_path) / srsly.read_json(json_path) / srsly.read_jsonl(jsonl_path)
